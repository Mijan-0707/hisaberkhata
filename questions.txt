1. Home Screen -> onCreateNewBatch() -> we use a StatefulBuilder. can't we use value notifyListeners on there?
2. in updateBatchName what if we check the newBatchName at first. why should we get all the batchNames and then checking the newBatchName.
3. cant find the use of batchname in studennt info screen.
4. in addNewStudents why do we adding the student info into student.value? we are going to replace the the full list.
5. what is barrierDismissible. we use it in studentlist-> studentListOnTapEdit().
6. on studentlist page at the bottom we use a condition can't we remove it?
